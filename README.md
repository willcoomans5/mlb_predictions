# MLB Pitch Classification with Neural Networks in PyTorch

In this notebook, I am using a dataset of over 700,000+ MLB pitches thrown in 2023, as captured by Statcast. I am working to classify 17 different MLB pitches using a neural network with 14 input features and one hidden layer with 16 neurons.
